# Shopping Cart

This project was created as the assignment for [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart).

## Assignment

1. You should have at least two pages (a homepage and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart). Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both routes.
2. On your shopping cart route, a user should see a sticky bar (it can be just a top section as well), which displays the number of items currently in the cart. You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (however we are not going to implement this logic here).
3. Build individual card items for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.
4. Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust.
